# RNN

##  recurrent neural networks (RNNs) 
RNNs are designed specifically to learn from sequences of data by passing the hidden state from one step in the sequence to the next step in the sequence, combined with the input.  

## long short-term memory (LSTM)
LSTMs are an improvement the RNNs, and are quite useful when our neural network needs to switch between remembering recent things, and things from long time ago.


But first, I want to give you some great references to study this further. There are many posts out there about LSTMs, here are a few of my favorites:

Chris Olah's LSTM post
Edwin Chen's LSTM post
Andrej Karpathy's blog post on RNNs
Andrej Karpathy's lecture on RNNs and LSTMs from CS231n
