---
## Part I:  Creating a Machine
### Step 1:  Where to start
- click on this link:  https://www.paperspace.com/console/machines

### Step 2:  Create a new machine
- select green button `New Machine`

### Step 3:  Choose region
- pick a data center
- Regions:  there are 3 regions available
   - West Coast (California)
   - East Coast (New York)
   - Europe
- pick the one closest to you; (for me it is East Coast (NYC))

### Step 4:  Choose template
- Select `Public Templates`
- Select icon for `fast.ai`

### Step 5:  Choose machine
- there are various machines with charges noted by the hour
- Paperspace is cheaper than Crestle, with fast machines
- if you choose the `$0.65/hr` machine, it may ask you to contact Paperspace asking why (anti-fraud step); let them know it is for **fast.ai** and they will get you up and running
- select the `$0.40/hr`, the cheapest one

### Step 6:  Choose storage
- note that you pay for storage as soon as you start the machine up
- select `250 GB ($7/month)` option; you can also get by with `50 GB ($5/month)` option too
- storage costs are pro-rated (like compute (or "usage") costs) 

### Step 7:  Options
- turn ON `Public IP` (cost is `$3/month`)
- turn OFF `Auto Snapshot` (to save money on doing back-ups)

### Step 8:  Payment
- add in a promo code:  **$15 credit code you can all use: FASTAI15**
- add in credit card information (required, even if you have a promo code)

### Step 9:  Create machine
- select `Create your Paperspace` box
- you'll see the new machine "provisioning"
- it takes about a minute
- you'll receive an email with subject *"Your new Paperspace Linux machine is ready"*
  - a temporary password will be included in that email
```text
Your temporary sign-in password for machine New Machine 1 is: *************

You can ssh into your new machine with the following command:ssh paperspace@184.105.2.222

Happy computing!
- The Paperspace Team
```

## :red_circle: Part III:  Updating fastai repo contents
* :key:  this step is important as having updated content and libraries can bypass errors

### Step 1:  go to directory
<kbd> cd fastai </kbd>  
```
(fastai) paperspace@psnqh1ltz:~$ cd fastai
(fastai) paperspace@psnqh1ltz:~/fastai$ pwd
/home/paperspace/fastai
(fastai) paperspace@psnqh1ltz:~/fastai$
```
### Step 2:  update repo 
<kbd> git pull </kbd>  
- from time to time, you should pull the latest `fastai` repo from GitHub
```bash
(fastai) paperspace@psnqh1ltz:~/fastai$ git pull
Already up-to-date.
```

### Step 3:  update Python / Anaconda libraries
<kbd> conda env update </kbd>  
- do this from time to time (every few weeks)

---
## Part IV:  Paperspace & Jupyter Notebook
### Step 1:  `cd` into fastai directory
- make sure you are here:  `/home/paperspace/fastai`
```bash
(fastai) paperspace@psgyqmt1m:~/fastai$ pwd
/home/paperspace/fastai
(fastai) paperspace@psgyqmt1m:~/fastai$
```

### Step 2:  Launch Jupyter Notebook
<kbd> jupyter notebook </kbd>  
```
(fastai) paperspace@psgyqmt1m:~/fastai$ jupyter notebook
[I 17:16:50.591 NotebookApp] Writing notebook server cookie secret to /run/user/1000/jupyter/notebook_cookie_secret
[W 17:16:51.110 NotebookApp] WARNING: The notebook server is listening on all IP addresses and not using encryption. This is not recommended.

[I 17:16:51.122 NotebookApp] The Jupyter Notebook is running at:

```

### Step 3:  Get Notebook url
- copy and paste url into your local browser (example:  Chrome, Firefox, Opera, etc)
- for me it is, and it **WON'T WORK**:   
http://localhost:8888/?token=44cd3335e311c181531f38031095a217b01127d8152aa3fd
- I need to replace `localhost` section with my `IP address`.  This **DOES WORK**:  
http://184.105.6.151:8888/?token=44cd3335e311c181531f38031095a217b01127d8152aa3fd

:boom:  Hooray, it works! :smiley:

## Part V:  Workflow
I opened the [Lesson 1 notebook](https://github.com/fastai/fastai/blob/master/courses/dl1/lesson1.ipynb), made a copy with the name `tmp-reshama-lesson1.ipynb`  

http://184.105.6.151:8888/notebooks/courses/dl1/lesson1.ipynb


## :red_circle: Part VI:  Shutting down Notebook & Machine
### :red_circle: Remember to shut the notebook down and STOP Instance! :moneybag: :red_circle:

- Paperspace has an option where you can choose to automatically shut down your machine at: 1 hr, 8 hrs, 1 day, 1 week
- I chose the `8 hrs` option
- :key: Note that the auto shut down works only for the browser console. **Paperspace will not auto shut down your server if you SSH to it.**
- [How do I use Auto-Shutdown on my Linux machine when connecting through SSH?](https://paperspace.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/115002807447-How-do-I-use-Auto-Shutdown-on-my-Linux-machine-when-connecting-through-SSH-)

# Optional Steps 
## Skip password and updating IP address in Jupyter Notebook link

## Setup:  Simplifying Logging in to Paperspace
Note:  the below commands are run on * **YOUR LOCAL COMPUTER** *

### Step 1:  Install `ssh-copy-id`
If you don't have it already, here's how to install it (Mac):  
```bash
brew install ssh-copy-id
```

### Step 2:  Ensure public keys are available
- `cd` into `~/.ssh` directory
- if you don't have an `.ssh` directory in your home folder, create it (`mkdir ~/.ssh`)
- if you don't have an `id_rsa.pub` file in your `~/.ssh` folder, create it (`ssh-keygen` and hit <kbd> Enter </kbd> 3 times)

### Step 3:  Copy public key to Paperspace
- replace IP address in syntax below with your own, and run command
```bash
ssh-copy-id -i ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub paperspace@184.105.2.222
```
### Step 4:  Add Paperspace info to `config` file
- make sure you are in the right directory
```bash
cd ~/.ssh
```

- if you don't have a `config` file, create one.  This example creates file using nano editor.  
```bash
nano config
```

- add these contents to your config file (replace IP address here with your Paperspace IP address)
```text
Host paperspace
     HostName 184.105.2.222
     IdentityFile ~/.ssh/id_rsa
     # StrictHostKeyChecking no  
     User paperspace
```
- here's the nano command for saving file  
<kbd> ctrl o </kbd>    
<kbd> Enter </kbd>  

- here's the nano command for exiting a file  
<kbd> ctrl x </kbd>
>my example of config file
```bash
% pwd
/Users/reshamashaikh/.ssh
```
```bash
% cat config
Host paperspace
     HostName 184.105.2.222
     IdentityFile ~/.ssh/id_rsa
     # StrictHostKeyChecking no  
     User paperspace
```

## ssh into Paperspace from local computer
```bash
ssh -L 8888:localhost:8888 paperspace
```

## start Jupyter Notebook from paperspace computer
- launch Jupyter Notebook after logging into paperspace computer
```bash
jupyter notebook
```

```bash

### Cool!  no password required, and no need to update notebook url with IP address
- this is my url link, and it works! :boom:
